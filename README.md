<h1>Planets Facts Website</h1>
Welcome to the Planets Facts website! Unlike typical setups using React Router, this project skips it for navigation and instead utilizes manual rendering for the navbar and home page components. Each planet's information is dynamically displayed using the map method and objects. This approach aims to deepen understanding of React fundamentals like mapping arrays and working with props and objects.

<h1>Why This Approach?</h1>
By avoiding React Router, the project prioritizes a deeper grasp of React concepts. It emphasizes proficiency in mapping techniques and manipulating object data within components.

<h1>Objectives</h1>
Enhance understanding of React fundamentals without relying on external libraries.
Provide an interactive platform for exploring planetary facts.
